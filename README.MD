ACFWidgets Plugin 
===================

This is a project worked on to improve quality of code around making WordPress plugins. It aims to solve a few issues that other ACFWidgetss fail to address. These include

- Namespacing & Autoloading
- Generic ACF & CPT examples and loading
- No convoluted routing or file includes 
- Simple structure
- Htaccess to block access to our files 
- Composer to force PHP versions
